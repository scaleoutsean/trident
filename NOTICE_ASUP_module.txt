4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or

Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in

Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:



  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of

    this License; and



  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that

    You changed the files; and



  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You

    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from

    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to

    any part of the Derivative Works; and



  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then

    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those

    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least

    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of

    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the

    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do

    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within

    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the

    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices

    cannot be construed as modifying the License.



You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide

additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or

distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,

provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

with the conditions stated in this License.



5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any

Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any

additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have

executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,

trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required

for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.



7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its

Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,

either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or

conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by

applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in

writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or

losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such

damages.



9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or

Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,

acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or

rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You

may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of

any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each

Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,

such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional

liability.
